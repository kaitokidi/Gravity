Gravity
=======

Hi people, 
Try to reach the white star with the same amount of time on each color, all is connected, (the difference between the maximum and minimum time must be less or equal than 3 to win the lvl) be careful, the time on a color is beeing updated for each corner of your square inside that color, you can move with the arrows and can jump with the upper arrow and space (the space will make u jump higher).
Good luck and have fun!

This Game started on the last 4 hours of the 30th Ludum dare, some friends were participating, but i had had no time that weekend, so i was not about to make any game, even that, while i was taking my dinner, i was chating with my friends who where participating, and i gone like "I want to do Games!!!", and checked the clock, the first impression was " ok 4 hours, you can't do anything",  "but, why not? it can be fun to do something very quickly" and it was.
Afther the first deliver, i have been pudating it because i like what i did, and so i improved it, fixed lots of bugs, improved the gameplay and the graphics, and even I'm still improving it when I find something that could go better, it is a "real" game now.

To use it, you will need SFML libs, on Ubuntu 14 they are already included, in another Operating sistem, you will need to install them
For Windows, in Visual studio (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-vc.php) 
for Linux users (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-linux.php), and for MAC OS (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-osx.php) .

To end this, I would like to thank my friends for make games that made me feel in a duty to make a game on that 30th Ludum dare too, all the people who tested and commented it, all the feedback recieved from phisical people and from anonimous people on the Ludum who made my day with positive comments and constructive feedback, and to the developers of SFML which are persons I respect and admire for their good job.
