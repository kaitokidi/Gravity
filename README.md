Gravity

Hi people, 
Try to reach the white star with the same amount of time on each color, all is connected, (the difference between the maximum and minimum time must be less or equal than 3 to win the lvl) be careful, the time on a color is beeing updated for each corner of your square inside that color, you can move with the arrows and can jump with the upper arrow and space (the space will make u jump higher).
Good luck and have fun!

To use it, you will need SFML libs, on Ubuntu 14 they are already included, in another Operating sistem, you will need to install them
For Windows, in Visual studio (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-vc.php) 
for Linux users (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-linux.php), and for MAC OS (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-osx.php) .
